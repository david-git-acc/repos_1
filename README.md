# repos_1
This is my first git repos so please forgive any inevitable things I will have missed.

This is the code for one of my data collection projects on thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk. 
I collected data from the site and compared things like entry standards vs graduate prospects, percentage of international students vs 
graduate prospects and research quality, etc. I also recorded the most common tags used on each university page to see what unis believe 
are the most attractive features to prospective students.

This is one of the groups of files I'd already completed before I started using Git(hub), so the formatting is very basic.

All of the programs have been commented. 

If you want to see the finished results, you can find them on my LinkedIn page:
